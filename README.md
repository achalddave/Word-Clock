# Word Clock

This is a clock made of letters that I wanted to make a while back. It's from
when my only experience with JS was piecing together jQuery plugins in hopes of
something neat, when Vim just meant
[soap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_%28cleaning_product%29) for me. 

Anyway, it looks sort of cool even though the code doesn't.
